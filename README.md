## Project Overview 

- The project uses [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) as a static site generator

	- Autoprefixer 
- PurgeCSS to remove unused CSS (set up for TailwindCSS by default) in production
- HTML minified in production
- CSS inlined and minified in production

## Deployment 

You can host the production output on any web server or service you like and upload it via any method, it'll work. 

If you don't have an existing place to host your site you should have a look at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), I can't recommend it enough. To get started you can hit the button below.
